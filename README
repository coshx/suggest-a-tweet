--- Overview ---
----------------

Despite what the repo name is, this project is currently TweetAlyze, rather than Suggest-A-Tweet. I bit off 
a bit more than I could chew for the hackathon so I reduced the scope a little. 
That said, I think it's still pretty cool. (But I'm biased. ;) )

TweetAlyze lets you analyze the word frequence for any Twitter user that is not blocked from public viewing
(which is almost all of them). You simply type in the name of the user and hit return (or push the handy button)
and off you go. Please note that it takes some time to analyze the results (especially on Android).

Words are listed with those being the most frequent at the top. You can tap on any word to see how many times
it was used by the person. You can filter the results by using the search box at the top. If you search for
a # sign you can see all the hashtags the person has used, and likewise an @ will show all people they
directly referenced.

If you want to search for the Tweets for a different user, go back to the top
screen and type in another name. (Some Android versions don't like this and crash if you try to search for a user
again. I'm not sure why this is. It works on the first try though, so if you want to see stats for multiple
users just run the program several times.)

--- Running this app ---
------------------------

You need to install Titanium to run this, preferably Titanium Studio. (It is possible to use from the command line but
I'm using Studio.) Pull the whole app into a directory and open it (or import it with that option if you prefer).
The homepage for all this stuff is: http://www.appcelerator.com/

You will need Xcode installed with the iOS libraries installed (which come with more recent versions of Xcode) on a Mac
to run the iPhone version. If you do development on a Mac you probably have this. If you don't, you can get it from
Apple's developer website. That site is: http://developer.apple.com/

If you want to try the app on Android (warning: iPhone version works better), you will need version 10 of
the Android SDK. You may or may not need your own device configured. Setting up the Android SDK is a little strange but
you can get started at http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html. 

Then just click the little 'play' button in the upper-left in the app explorer view. If you don't see that, try clicking
the arrow next to the 'play' icon in the main icon bar. The iPhone version runs much faster than the Android one and
looks nicer, so I really suggest that.

--- Things to do in the future ---
----------------------------------

- Add some sort of backend aggregating server so you can compare people to Twitter as a whole
- Add in OAuth support so you can log in and analyze your home timeline (instead of just your own Tweets)
- Get more statistics - eg, what percentage of Tweets contain a given word?
- Stability fixes for Android  
- Get more than 200 Tweets once OAuth is working
